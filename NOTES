Not sure if the interior ghosts are getting set correctly.   While
setting up the mesh, going through the increasing levs, I found that the mesh
was getting refined in strange places.  It was finding a vertical gradient where
the solution should be uniform, indicating that these ghost interiors were
not getting properly set following the init_state_on_level.  When I changed
the init_state_on_level to loop over all cells including ghost and set on all
those cells, it worked, but this is not a good fix.  We need to make sure interior
ghosts are getting set.
